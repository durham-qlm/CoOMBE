   nstates = 24  ! Number of states. This must be the same
                 ! as the value given to nst in the 
                 ! general_settings module. 
 
   nmin = 1      ! Smallest state index.
 
   nfields = 1   ! Number of fields.

   icmplxfld = 0 ! Indicates whether the field amplitudes,
                 ! dipole moments and Rabi frequencies are specified
                 ! as real numbers (icmplxfld = 0) or as complex numbers
                 ! (icmplxfld = 1) in the input files. The variable fields
                 ! must be used to specify these data in the former case,
                 ! and whatever is specified in the cfields variable is
                 ! ignored. The variable cfields must be used in the latter
                 ! case and whatever is specified in the fields variable is
                 ! ignored.
 
!  Name(s) of the file(s) containing the rest of the required information:

   filename_controlparams = 'Rb85D1_c.dat'
   filename_defaultdata = 'Rb85D1_d.dat'
